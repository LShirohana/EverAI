# EverAI
This is a bot that attempts to play EverAI. It also, due to how it's coded, has the capability of becoming a TAS bot *as well* as a "perfect" bot.

Currently, it does some neat moves, but has troubles with moving left/right at the best timings. It also cannot deflect. That being said, it can do most medium/hard songs that I've tested it on.

#Here is a short demonstration
